# CU-boids

Experimental app whilst learning [CUDA Thrust](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/archive/12.3.0/thrust/index.html) and [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui).

Build with:

```sh
mkdir build
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

This is hastily reworked from my [imgui-cmake](https://github.com/alexallmont/imgui-cmake) project to also link CUDA and Thrust.
